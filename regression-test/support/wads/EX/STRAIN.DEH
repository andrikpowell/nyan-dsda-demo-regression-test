CyberMan: you don't have one, so of course it doesn't work.

Text 405 404
YOU HAVE ENTERED DEEPLY INTO THE INFESTED
STARPORT. BUT SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE
MONSTERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OWN REALITY
WITH THEM, AND THE STARPORT'S TECHNOLOGY
IS BEING SUBVERTED BY THEIR PRESENCE.

AHEAD, YOU SEE AN OUTPOST OF HELL, A
FORTIFIED ZONE. IF YOU CAN GET PAST IT,
YOU CAN PENETRATE INTO THE HAUNTED HEART
OF THE STARBASE AND FIND THE CONTROLLING
SWITCH WHICH HOLDS EARTH'S POPULATION
HOSTAGE.AGAIN, EARTH IS SECURED! YOU HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY SLAUGHTERED YOUR WAY
TO THE LUNAR SHIPPING STATION.
THERE IS A CARGO LINER PREPPED ON
THE LAUNCH PAD STILL SPILLING OUT
THE DEVIL'S CHILDREN IT BROUGHT ON
IT'S LAST JOURNEY. YOU CLIMB ABOARD
SMEARING THE DIRTY STEEL WITH THE
BLUE-RED BLOOD FROM YOUR BOOTS.
THE BLACK DRUGS ARE REACHING FULL
EFFECT NOW.

NEXT STOP:
THE MOON. DARK SIDE. STATION DARO.        

Text 617 619
YOU HAVE WON! YOUR VICTORY HAS ENABLED
HUMANKIND TO EVACUATE EARTH AND ESCAPE
THE NIGHTMARE.  NOW YOU ARE THE ONLY
HUMAN LEFT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.
CANNIBAL MUTATIONS, CARNIVOROUS ALIENS,
AND EVIL SPIRITS ARE YOUR ONLY NEIGHBORS.
YOU SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR DEATH, CONTENT
THAT YOU HAVE SAVED YOUR SPECIES.

BUT THEN, EARTH CONTROL BEAMS DOWN A
MESSAGE FROM SPACE: "SENSORS HAVE LOCATED
THE SOURCE OF THE ALIEN INVASION. IF YOU
GO THERE, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BLOCK THEIR
ENTRY.  THE ALIEN BASE IS IN THE HEART OF
YOUR OWN HOME CITY, NOT FAR FROM THE
STARPORT." SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY YOU GET
UP AND RETURN TO THE FRAY.THE NEW MUTATIONS OF EVIL ARE NASTIER
THAN ANY GHOUL EVER DREAMED UP BY THE
MOST OPIUM-STARVED OF POETS.
EVEN SO, HOW IN THE HELL DID THESE
LITTLE BUGGERS SPREAD SO FAR SO FAST?
A SIXTH SENSE TELLS YOU TO SURPRESS
YOUR CURIOSITY. COMMAND CONTROL HAS
BEEN CLEARED, AND THE POWER STATION
AWAITS. YOU BLAST ONE LAST DOPPLEGANGER.
WITH YOUR ACHING FINGERS, YOU STUFF A
DOZEN MORE SHELLS IN THE SHOTGUN BEFORE
HIS LIFELESS BODY HITS THE FLOOR. YOUR
TRANSFORMATION IS COMPLETE. THE PIT
OF SIN BETTER HAVE STRONGER WARRIORS
AHEAD THAN THESE.     YOU KNOW IT WILL.                  
                                            

Text 312 315
YOU ARE AT THE CORRUPT HEART OF THE CITY,
SURROUNDED BY THE CORPSES OF YOUR ENEMIES.
YOU SEE NO WAY TO DESTROY THE CREATURES'
ENTRYWAY ON THIS SIDE, SO YOU CLENCH YOUR
TEETH AND PLUNGE THROUGH IT.

THERE MUST BE A WAY TO CLOSE IT ON THE
OTHER SIDE. WHAT DO YOU CARE IF YOU'VE
GOT TO GO THROUGH HELL TO GET TO IT?A FLASH OF REALIZATION: YOU WERE
WITNESS TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
"VERY LAST OF THE DEMONS ON EARTH"...

ON EARTH! NOW WOULD THE GOVERNMENT,
THE CAUSE OF ALL YOUR TROUBLES, STORE
THESE CREATURES ON THE MOON AND
EXPERIMENT ON THEM, INCOMPETENTLY
CREATING A NEW STRAIN?

YOU'LL HANDLE THOSE IN CHARGE... YOUR WAY.   

Text 494 495
THE HORRENDOUS VISAGE OF THE BIGGEST
DEMON YOU'VE EVER SEEN CRUMBLES BEFORE
YOU, AFTER YOU PUMP YOUR ROCKETS INTO
HIS EXPOSED BRAIN. THE MONSTER SHRIVELS
UP AND DIES, ITS THRASHING LIMBS
DEVASTATING UNTOLD MILES OF HELL'S
SURFACE.

YOU'VE DONE IT. THE INVASION IS OVER.
EARTH IS SAVED. HELL IS A WRECK. YOU
WONDER WHERE BAD FOLKS WILL GO WHEN THEY
DIE, NOW. WIPING THE SWEAT FROM YOUR
FOREHEAD YOU BEGIN THE LONG TREK BACK
HOME. REBUILDING EARTH OUGHT TO BE A
LOT MORE FUN THAN RUINING IT WAS.
YOU'VE DESTROYED EVERY LAST DENIZEN OF
DOOM. PERIOD.  YOU ALSO DESTROYED THE
GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE SPACE STATION,
WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE A SEVERED, BOBBING
HEAD. WEIRD.
IT'S OVER. THIS SHOULD IMPRESS BABES.
THEN AGAIN, YOU ARE A BLOATED, PSYCHIC,
FREAKY MADMAN NOW. PERHAPS YOU CAN
START A GAME COMPANY AND WRITE 3D ENGINES
WITH YOUR ALTERED BRAIN.  THAT SHOULD
CAUSE THE COMPETITION TO SPUTTER AND
JERK AND BLATHER OUT UNREAL-ISTIC CLAIMS.

THANKS FOR PLAYING!

CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE FOUND THE SECRET

HUMANS, RATHER THAN DEMONS. YOU WONDER
WHO THE INMATES OF THIS CORNER OF HELL

FLOORPLAN. AND WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?
LOOKS LIKE DARO HAS GOTTEN SOME UNEXPECTED
RENOVATIONS. THIS IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.
